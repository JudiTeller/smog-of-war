# SMOG OF WAR
Smog of War is developed as submission for the [13th Pirate Software Game Jam](https://develop.games/gamejam/).  The game jam's theme is "Do No Harm".  

In our game the player is sent to a city district full of smog, garbage and disease, and is supposed to reestablish a liveable environment for the city's population. 
Our game aims to be a mix between a classic clicker game and a very basic city builder with a touch of resource management.  
Initially, clicking gives the player access to basic resources, with which buildings can be placed / upgraded to get more resources or access new resources.

## Introduction
### Game Summary Pitch
Smog of War aims to be a mix between a classic clicker game and a very basic city builder and a touch of resource management. 
Initially, clicking gives the player access to basic resources, with which buildings can be placed / upgraded to get more resources or access new resources.


## Inspiration
### Cookie Clicker (and other clicker games)
Those games bring the most basic gameplay aspect: clicking objects to gain resources. Spend resources on upgrades and new buildings / machines / helpers to gather even more resources.

### Terra Nil
This game is the inspiration for the concept of reversing nature exploitation and some visual cues. For aesthetics, we want to adapt the isometric viewing angle and an even lower res spriting style.


## Player Experience
The main goal of the game loop is to clean a part of a city from smog, garbage and diseases.
The player will need to gather resources to build new eco-friendly or healthcare buildings or upgrade existing ones to be less toxic.
In the beginning, the resource gathering will consist of clicking on human NPCs to “cure” them. The resources will be given out as the reward.
After reaching a specific threshold of cleansing, the player can advance to the next city / city part.


## Concept
### Gameplay overview
The player will click on human NPCs to cure them to gather resources.
With those resources, one of two building types can be built or upgrades can be bought. 
The first type is to help gather resources. The second one is to achieve the goal of cleaning the district.
Although the player has a choice between the two types, both are necessary for progression. (Even if the district is smog free, the citizens still need medical attention.)

### Theme Interpretation (Do no harm)
*‘harm’ interpretation - The negative effect of an action to a person or an environment.*

*‘Do no harm’ interpretation - To prevent or counteract a harming effect.*

In our interpretation, the player is sent to a city district full of smog, garbage and disease. The environment seen in the game will depict an exploited and monotonous cityscape.
Through the intervention of the player, the district will slowly be restored to a livable space.
